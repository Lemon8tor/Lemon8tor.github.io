            <h2>Intrests</h2>
            <p> One of my Intrests is music. It takes me away and makes me forget my problems. My favorite type of music is Rock and I only listen to music form the 70's, 80's, and 90's.
                Another one of my intrests is video games. I have a ps4 which is really fun.
